# ceaser-cypher
yeah I def cant spell
This is a caeser cypher made in html and javascript it is based on the cyber security thing that happened last week or 2 weeks ago I lose track of time
But yeah all you need to do is download the file called caeser and unzip it, if you dont know how to unzip a file look up a youtube video. Doing that will allow you to access the file and you will run it like normal and for some reason you dont know how to do that I am sorry but you maybe shouldn't be looking at this file.
